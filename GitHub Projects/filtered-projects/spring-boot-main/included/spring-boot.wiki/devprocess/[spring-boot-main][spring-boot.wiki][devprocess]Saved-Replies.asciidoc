== Crosspost
[source,markdown]
----
Thanks for reporting, but I notice you've also posted the same question on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). It's better if in the future you don't cross-post questions as it makes it hard for people searching to find answers. I'll close this one in favor of Stack Overflow.

== Dependency PR
[source,markdown]
----
Thanks for the PR, but as mentioned in the [pull request template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) we have a semi-automated process for dependency upgrades that we prefer to use.

== Guys
[source,markdown]
----
Thanks for the report, I've edited your description to replace "guys" with "everyone". While it may seem like a small thing, some people feel excluded by "guys" and we don't want them to.

== Moved to Stack Overflow
[source,markdown]
----
Thanks for getting in touch, but it feels like this is a question that would be better suited to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). As mentioned in [the guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#using-github-issues), we prefer to use GitHub issues only for bugs and enhancements. Feel free to update this issue with a link to the re-posted question (so that
other people can find it) or add some more details if you feel this is a genuine bug.

== Not much demand
[source,markdown]
----
We're cleaning out the issue tracker and closing issues that we've not seen much demand to fix. Feel free to comment with additional justifications if you feel that this one should not have been closed.

== Sample
[source,markdown]
----
If you'd like us to spend some time investigating, please take the time to provide a complete minimal sample (something that we can unzip or git clone, build, and deploy) that reproduces the problem.

== Request for dependency upgrade
[source,markdown]
----
There is no need to ask for a dependency upgrade.

As mentioned in our issue template:
> You DO NOT need to raise an issue for a managed dependency version upgrade as there's a semi-automatic process for checking managed dependencies for new versions before a release.

We will perform upgrades matching [our 3rd party upgrade policy](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Supported-Versions#third-party-dependencies).
If this is an urgent matter for you, there is no need to wait for us releasing as you can use a [Gradle](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#managing-dependencies.dependency-management-plugin.customizing) or [Maven](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#using.parent-pom) build property to override the library version.
All [version properties are listed in the reference documentation appendix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#appendix.dependency-versions.properties).
