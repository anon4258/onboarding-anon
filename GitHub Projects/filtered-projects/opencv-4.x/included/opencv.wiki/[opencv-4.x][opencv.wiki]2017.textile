** Ideas for next year

h3. *_Minutes_*

* OpenCV 3.3.1 has been finally released! 
** https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog

*** results of a few GSoC projects. 
**** A few more have been merged in right after the release, and other are still being evaluated.
*** the new deep learning-based face detection
*** YOLO support
*** OpenCL acceleration of DNN (for now it support Intel GPUs only)
*** We are slowly advancing in developing our "mini Halide" thing: 
**** https://github.com/vpisarev/Halide/tree/mini_master
** OpenCV 3.4 should be out in December. The main goals for it are:
*** merge most of the remaining GSoC PRs (partly done already).
*** further improve deep learning module in terms of supported topologies. 
*** polish OpenCL acceleration; 
*** improve CPU performance as well.
*** make it solid enough, as it will possibly be the last major OpenCV 3.x release.
*** deprecate C API and 
*** maybe some other things that will be removed from OpenCV 4.0.
** Some other highlights
*** R3 of Intel SDK
*** Deep learning face detector
*** GPU accelerations
*** Some of Google of Code
*** Some security fixes finally
* Ideas for 2018
** Start the wiki for this
** Medial Axis transform
** Gamma correction
** HighGUI QT: LGPL. Add improvements, maybe replace the QT dependency
** Documentation for opencv_contrib! Need better organization and to toss non-supported stuff
** Pre-trained, memory reduced

h3. _*Agenda*_
* General progress
* Accelerations

h3. *_Minutes_*

1. In September we've set a record on the number of PRs merged and issues closed, 6.1 and 5.5 per working day, respectively.
2. We will release OpenCV 3.3.1 this or next week.
3. OpenCL acceleration of dnn module has been integrated, and its performance is better than Halide or previous OpenCL backend offer, but it's still not as fast as the best implementations (e.g. clDNN). But we clearly see where the performance can be improved. In particular, layer fusion can give some noticeable performance improvements.
4. We've added support for networks with FP16 (half-precision) weights to DNN model importers. In Caffe such models are supported through experimental patch from NVidia. In TF there is official support for FP16. We only support the latter. Since there is no full support for FP16 in OpenCV in general and in DNN in particular, we convert such models to FP32 on-fly. This let us to compress some of the models, e.g. object detection (MobileNet-SSD) and face detection (Reset-10+SSD) by factor of 2. E.g. face detection network is just 5Mb. We measured the detection accuracy on some popular databases and found no differences in results. So far so good. Processing the networks in FP16 arithmetics on GPUs with FP16 support (most modern GPUs from Intel, AMD and NVidia support FP16) could be the logical next step.


* Checkout the "Amazon--Microsoft compiler work":https://aws.amazon.com/it/blogs/ai/introducing-nnvm-compiler-a-new-open-end-to-end-compiler-for-ai-frameworks/ called NNVM Compiler
** This flow looks very similar to TensorFlow framework -- graph, optimize, compile, but is completely centric to TensorFlow
** Washington U wanted to standardize PyTorch, Tiny-DNN, Caffe ... but after GSoC ended, lost momentum. 
* But, also see "clDNN for working on Intel and AMD architectures":https://github.com/01org/clDNN
* In general, we'll want OpenCV to run on as many frameworks as possible. Halide seems a possible, write once run many, but there are many people doing many things and there is also TensorFlow which was once part of the Amazon post.

h2. 2017-09-26

h3. _*Agenda*_
* GSoC starts again
* Javascript
* DNN

h3. *_Minutes_*
* *GSoC*
** Basic themes
*** _Ever better Python integration -- pybind next for cv::Mat to make it seemless_
*** _ Vision kernels to Halide -- ever more optimized_
*** _More support for DNN -- more kernels, functionality, moved to learned, memory efficient nets_
** Payoneer payment is in ... didn't miss the deadline!
** Image processing kernels => Halide
*** So that we can automatically generate vectorized code
*** And an OpenCL backend
*** Can generate OpenGL, Cuda, and many more kernals
** Python bindings ... boost python
*** C++ bindings OpenCV cv::Mat to pybind so that we are more seemless in Python
**** Exposing more of cv::Mat
**** computational photography
** Waiting for final videos from GSoC
* *Javascript bindings are now integrated into OpenCV main supported code!* 
** ... big win from this years GSoC and lots of thanks to *Intel* And... 
** Super thanks to *Mohammad Haghighat* for kicking this off and seeing it through
* *16b floating point format*
** We are adding for OpenCV so that it can run more memory efficient floating point operations, particularly for deepnets
* *DNN*
** TensorFlow, Caffe, Torch, and some darknet
** For GSoC, theme of squeezing memory down for model zoo of very memory efficient nets
*** Fixed point networks, memory tuning, etc. (last CVPR). 100Mb down to 5Mb
**** Not just quantization. Represent each product of weights as product of 3 factorized matrices UVD
***** U and V consist of -1, 0, 1 and diagonal 
** CPU optimization already
** GPU optimization merged soon ... OpenCL, but tuned so far for integrated GPU
*** So, if there is OpenCL optimization, it can be backported in

h3. *_Minutes_*
* *GSOC*
** Evaluations due by, Friday, June 30. 
** "See the Google timeline":https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/
** "Start evaluations here":https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/
** "OpenCV Google Summer of Code 2017 page":https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2017
* *"CVPR":http://cvpr2017.thecvf.com/program/main_conference*
** Most of us get in the Thursday before the tutorials. Meet up!
** We will have a sponsored bar meet somewhere for collected students, professionals etc, TBD
** OpenCV will be running a tutorial: "OpenCV 3.x New Functionality & Optimizations":http://cvpr2017.thecvf.com/program/tutorials
* *OpenCV 3.3 Release*
** It planned to be out middle of July
** But it's ahead of schedule!
*** Maybe out next week or week after, early part of week
** Major news is that DNN Module is moving out of "opencv_contrib":https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib joining the core of "OpenCV":https://github.com/opencv/opencv in this uppcoming release 3.3
*** DNN is a module that reads deep net models trained by other frameworks and runs them efficiently
**** This is especially true on Intel CPUs and Intel GPUs (*Thanks Intel for the support!!!*), but 
**** DNN will run other networks efficiently in general due to optimized C++ and increasing use of Halide. 
***** This is still a work in progress (the Halide parts are not intensively optimized yet, still they perform well), but advancing rapidly.
**** DNN now reads and optimizes run times for the following major CNN libraries:
***** Caffe
***** TensorFlow
***** Torch
***** By end of summer, it should also cover OpenCV's "tiny_dnn library":https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn
*** "See the wiki page for DNN Module performance":https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/DNN-efficiency-measurements
*** For comparison (and we might start to contribute to this) see below:
**** *NOTE:*
***** These numbers are either much slower because they on mobile chips, or
***** they are faster because they use a more powerful GPU.
**** Excellent site: "Overall performance of CNNs":http://cknowledge.org/repo/web.php?action=index&module_uoa=wfe&native_action=show&native_module_uoa=program.optimization

*** It's library in C++, but limited operators
*** Good for image processing, deep nets
*** Not good if your code needs logical operators w/in the processing loop
**** The gradients of Canny operator yes, not the line thinning
** Maybe something out by CVPR
** Ability to implement kernels in Halide
* GSoC 2017
** Our slot asks are in
** We find out allocation tomorrow, April 19
** We will then have an email conference of the admins
*** We will scrape the list, if we feel we have too many slots, we'll try to return unneeded ones quickly.
* CVPR 2017
** Vadim will give a tutorial there
** Several of us will be there (Vincent, Vadim, Gary)

h3. _*Agenda*_

* GSoC decisions

h3. *_Minutes_*

* For DNN (just reading and running nets trained in Torch, TenserFlow, Caffe etc), it will translate to Halide and then run taking advantage of the architecture.
** Going to OpenCL straight can result in unstable code, this way you generate efficient OpenCL for GPU.
* We have a strong mentor for SLAM this year ... might go with it if we can find the right student.
* Stereo via flow net
* Support for Halide? Seems great for basic deepnet stuff, simple image processing
** See Idea 17 https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2017#2017-project-ideas
* Would be great to get a model zoo of squeezed, high performance deep nets for DNN or for tiny-dnn, these are highly useful.
*


h3. *_To Dos_*

* -Gary to send out reminder for students to apply to the GSoC site-
* -Gary to remind mentors to start reviewing/deciding on possible/students/topics ... commit.-

** Can we develop radically smaller deep networks for text detection. Squeeze nets?
**
* DNN will read Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow and run it fast.
* "Colormap for SFM and multi-view":https://github.com/colmap/colmap is "cool":https://colmap.github.io/ , but its GPL.

* Gary to send out another announcement to post on GSOC site
** Submit via google doc

* Admins were screwed up by daylight savings, so most of the team missed the meeting. It was decided anyhow that the main useful activity is to review student proposals. Go to:
** "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2017":https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2017
* JPEGXS (sequences) https://jpeg.org/jpegxs/
* JPEG lightfield https://jpeg.org/items/20170208_cfp_pleno.html
* GSOC
** Curved edge detection

** DNN Intel contributing 
*** Training mini-batch -- can be pluralized across samples
*** Inference -- one sample
** Project to detect useful objects
*** Face
*** Pedestrian 
*** Car
*** Smaller architectures is 50x smaller than Alex net for example
**** Optimization on mobile -- model has to be compact, just a few GFLOPs, run quantized, code flow should be optimized for the architecture but this is beyond scope for a student
** Squeeze net ... tiny_dnn
*** Gam low power
** Improving Tutorials
*** How to use the deep learning
*** Update existing tutorials
*** Tracking
*** Computational photography
*** Camera calibration
*** Video stabilization ... or improve it
*** Image stitching 
** April tags or Aruco to make a true checkerboard as tags 
** Improve Aruco and Charuco code
** SLAM ? All efforts have failed. Only if we can find someone far along in a related thesis
** Better background subtraction
*** Deep?  
*** Current MoG has a flaw -- all pixels independently -- no smoothness, spacial constraints
** --We have better optical flow now--
** Better saliency model. Improve saliency API
** Video stabilization, or just improve tutorial
** Labeling module ...
*** Improve VATIC (contact authors?)
**** [[https://github.com/cvondrick/vatic]]
**** [[http://web.mit.edu/vondrick/vatic/]]
** OpenCV for artistic interaction
*** Natural interaction 
*** Hand pose? 
** Text detection improvement ... better datasets. 

* Hard to know quality level of different code in contrib
** Put quality, optimization, GPU optimiztion, in Wiki
** computational photography
** SFM
** Make a Wiki to track
** Tracking with CNN doesn't have GPU optimization
