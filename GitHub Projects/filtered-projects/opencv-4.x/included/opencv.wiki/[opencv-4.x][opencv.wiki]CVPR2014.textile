h1. Open CV 3.0: Solving Problems

The third major release of OpenCV is aimed at building solid ground for computer vision development.  C++ and Python will be covered here.  OpenCV 3.0 enables:
* more algorithms to be integrated (of which we will showcase the latest)
* more supported languages (Matlab, Ruby, Haskell)
* more optimizations (NEON, OpenVX)
* a new and modular way of participating to the core development

While showcasing the aforementioned features, we will focus building end-to-end vision pipelines through several application walk-throughs.  Code, instructions, and mobile applications will be available online before the tutorial.

h2. Lecturers

*Dr. Gary Rost Bradski*
!images/GaryBradski.jpg!
is VP of Perception and Core Software at Magic Leap.  Gary founded OpenCV at Intel Research in 2000 and is currently CEO of non-profit OpenCV.org.  He ran the vision team for Stanley, the autonomous vehicle that completed and won the $2M DARPA Grand Challenge robot race across the desert.  Dr. Bradski helped start up NeuroScan (sold to Marmon), Video Surf (sold to Microsoft), and Willow Garage (absorbed into Suitable Tech).  Most recently, he founded Industrial Perception (sold August 2013).  Gary has more than 100 publications and more than 30 patents and is co-author of a best seller in its category Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library, O'Reilly Press.

*Patrick O'Keef*
!images/PatOKeefeS.png!
is a computer vision engineer at Occipital. He loves and works on everything related to RGBD and the Structure Sensor (from firmware to SLAM), and holds an MSEE from the University of Michigan in Signal Processing."

*Vincent Rabaud*
!images/vincent.jpg!
is the perception team manager at Aldebaran Robotics.  He co-founded the non-profit OpenCV.org with Gary Bradski in 2012 while a research engineer at Willow Garage.  His research interests include 3D processing, object recognition and anything that involves underusing CPUs by feeding them fast algorithms.  Dr. Rabaud completed his PhD at UCSD, advised by Serge Belongie.  He also holds a MS in space mechanics and space imagery from SUPAERO and a MS in optimization from the Ecole Polytechnique.

*Grace Vesom*
!images/grace.jpg!
is a computer vision engineer at Magic Leap. Previously, she was a research scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory working on computer vision and machine learning algorithms for global security applications.  She completed her DPhil at the University of Oxford with Alison Noble and Mike Brady in 2010.
