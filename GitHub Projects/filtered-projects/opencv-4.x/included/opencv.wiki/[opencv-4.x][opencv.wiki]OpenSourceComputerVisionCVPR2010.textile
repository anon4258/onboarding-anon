The programming exercise is now included in OpenCV download in
<code> .../opencv/samples/cpp/select3dobj.cpp</code></pre>

This program allows you to:

# Put down a calibration chessboad
# Draw a 3D box around the object you want to capture
# As you move the camera (as long as both the calibration pattern and the object can be seen), the program will output a
* 3D bounding box in the calibration coordinate sys.
** given as 4 points, 3 on the ground plane and one point that gives the “Z” height from the plane.
* For each object view:
** R,T of the bounding box points
** File name of the tight grab cut segmented image
