=== Notes ===
*Scrapy must be installed with Python 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7 (NOT 3.x)
*Python 2.7 (and 3.2) do not load the correct 32-bit compatible Windows Registry Keys


=== Install Procedure ===
#Download the Python 2.7.2 Windows Installer from http://www.python.org/getit/
#Go to the ''Search programs and files'' bar at the bottom of the start menu and type "regedit" and hit enter
#Using the left pane navigate to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python" & click on it (highlighting it in blue)
##With the branch selected go to File --> Export
##Save the file somewhere you can get to it easily
##Open the file in your favorite text editor
##Insert "\Wow6432Node" inbetween "SOFTWARE" and "\Python" on every line (an easy way to do this is to do a find and replace with "SOFTWARE" in the Find Field and "SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node" in the Replace Field
##Save the file
##Navigate to where you saved said file and double click on it to initiate a Registry Modification
#Now download the Scrapy 0.14 Windows installer from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Scrapy
#Double click the Scrapy Installer and everything should work fine.
#Download and install Twisted 11.1.0 for Python 2.7 64 bits from http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads
#Download and install Zope.Interface
##Download distribute_setup.py from http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py (right click & save), then double click it to install
##Download zope.interface-3.8.0-py2.6-win-amd64.egg from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface/3.8.0#downloads
##Open a command prompt (type "cmd" into the same ''Search programs and files'' pane as above) and navigate to your Python Scripts folder (something like "cd C:\Python27\Scripts")
##type "easy_install C:\Downloads\zope.interface-3.8.0-py2.6-win-amd64.egg" (replacing C:\Downloads\ with wherever you downloaded Zope.Interface to) and hit enter
#Download and install lxml-2.3.2.win-amd64-py2.7.â€Œexe from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
#Download and install pyOpenSSL-0.9.win32-py2.6.msi from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyopenssl/files/pyopenssl-win/0.9/
#*When it ask you to navigate to a Python 2.6 Directory, just point it to your Python 2.7 Directory (C:\Python27 by default)
#Install w3lib
##Open a command prompt (Start -> ''Search programs and files'' -> "cmd")
##Navigate to your Python Scripts Folder (nominally "C:\Python27\Scripts")
##Type "easy_install w3lib" and hit enter
#Now we just need to add the Python Scripts folder to the System Path so we can use scrapy
##Click the "Start Menu" button and Right Click on "Computer" and select "Properties"
##Click "Advanced system settings" in the left bar
##Click "Environment Variables..."
##Find the "Path" variable in the (lower) System variables Pane and double click on it
##Click in the "Variable value:" pane and hit the "End" button
##Type, or paste, ";C:\Python27\Scripts\" (modify for wherever you installed Python) at the end of the line
##*Be sure not to disturb or change any of the existing information there
##Hit OK, OK,OK, X

*You MIGHT have to install PyWin32.  I did so in an effort to fix another problem as it was recommended by the Scrapy Installation Guide.  Although it didn't fix the problem I was targeting it may have prevent other problems from arising.  Install PyWin32 if you are having problems
*#Download pywin32-216.win-amd64-py2.7.exe from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build216/
*#Double click the downloaded file & install the software
